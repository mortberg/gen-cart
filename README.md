# Generalized Cartesian Cubical Type Theory

Agda code for a Cartesian cubical set model of univalent type theory
based on a weakened version of ABCFHL fibrations. This generalizes the
construction in https://github.com/dlicata335/cart-cube and
https://github.com/IanOrton/cubical-topos-experiments/.


This code is based on the formalization accompanying Ian Orton's
Ph.D. thesis which can be found at:
https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/288558. We are grateful
for Ian's permission to use his code.
